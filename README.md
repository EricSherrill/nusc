#NetApp Usable Space Calculator

**This is not an official NetApp tool.**

Based on the NetApp Technical Report [TR-3838](http://www.netapp.com/us/media/tr-3838.pdf), Storage Subsystem Configuration Guide.

This is to help with capacity sizings for various drive, protection and reserve configurations on Data ONTAP and uses the calculations from that TR.
